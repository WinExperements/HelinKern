HelinOS UEFI bootloader for Lumia based devices.
=======================================

This bootloader code is based on boot shim ELF loading mechanism and custom boot protocol.

The ArmDeInitalize has been disabled because with him the kernel can't access to the PSF font header and device reboots into EDL/BULK mode.

Original BootShim description:

Boot Shim (UEFI Variant)
=======================================

Boot Shim is a small ARM32 Windows Boot Manager Application that intended to 
chain-load ARM64 UEFI [hacked Lumias](http://wpinternals.net), and particularly Lumia 950/950 XL.

It is based on [UEFI-Simple](https://github.com/pbatard/uefi-simple). 
IDE-debugging is not supported.

## Prerequisites

* [Visual Studio 2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/community/) with ARM support
* Git

## Sub-Module initialization

For convenience, the project relies on the gnu-efi library, so you need to initialize the git
submodule either through git commandline with:
```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```
Or, if using a UI client (such as TortoiseGit) by selecting _Submodule Update_ in the context menu.

## Compilation and testing

Only Visual Studio is supported in this branch. Do not use `Release` mode, it won't work.

I used a well-known certificate from Windows Kits to sign the binary. You can replace with yours.

## Visual Studio 2017 and ARM support

Please be mindful that, to enable ARM compilation support in Visual Studio
2017, you __MUST__ go to the _Individual components_ screen in the setup application
and select the ARM compilers and libraries there, as they do __NOT__ appear in
the default _Workloads_ screen:
